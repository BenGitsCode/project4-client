Memory GA book connects people that recently graduated GA. It creates a collection of people's memories and keeps them in one place.

Each user is able to see all users memories without signing in. Once the user creates an account, the user can add its own memory and further update it or delete it from the dashboard. One user can have multiple stories/memories.

GA was one of the best yet most intense programs I have ever done, and time flew by so quickly. I'm about to finish GA, but I know that there is a new chapter coming right after. We all changed. We learned a lot. We grew professionally and personally. We experienced this program differently. Being able to hear how other people experienced this program motivated me to create this app. This app can keep us together and connected through one thing we all went through -- GA.  Memories are organized by date.

I have created admin functionality too. If anyone post a comment that doesn't belong on the dashboard, I can edit it or delete it.
